This is a poorly written, disorganized, and mostly useless cookbook. There will be no measurements provided, cause everything is by feeling. Because getting 90% of the way there with 10% of the effort is worthwhile 200% of the time. This is based on my experiences as a homecook the past few years, and I've compiled my style and laziness into this blunt cookbook. If you're sticking around to read and gain something valuable from this, thank you!! I guess?!

## who is this for?

1. Anyone who doesn't have measuring tools in the kitchen
1. Anyone who is lazy
1. Anyone who only needs food that's good enough most of the time

## who isn't this for?

1. Anyone trying to be a serious cook
1. Anyone who enjoys cooking
1. Anyone who actually needs to learn something
