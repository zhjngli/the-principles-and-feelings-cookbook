This is a poorly written, disorganized, and mostly useless cookbook. There will be no measurements provided, cause everything is by [feeling](/principles/cooking-with-feelings). Because getting 90% of the way there with 10% of the effort is worthwhile 200% of the time.

## what's the motivation for writing this?

My wife thinks I cook pretty well, and so do other people who've had my food. But it's hard for me to give out recipes because I basically have none, I just have broad strokes of what to do when making a dish. So, I've compiled my style, laziness, and experiences as a homecook for the past few years into this blunt cookbook.

## who is this for?

1. Anyone who doesn't have measuring tools in the kitchen
1. Anyone who is lazy
1. Anyone who only needs food that's good enough most of the time

## who isn't this for?

1. Anyone trying to be a serious cook
1. Anyone who enjoys cooking
1. Anyone who actually needs to learn something

## how should you go about reading this cookbook?

1. Start with [cooking with feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings). This sets the stage for the rest of the book and will help you determine whether you will find the cookbook legitimately useful.
1. After that, check out some more [principles](/principles). These principles help you get a better grasp of overall cooking (hopefully).
1. Then, read some [recipes](/recipes). Again, no measurements included here, just broad strokes of what I do.
1. [Techniques](/techniques) may also be helpful here and there, but will likely be linked from different sections of the book as well.

If you're sticking around to read and you gain something valuable from this, thank you!! I guess?!
