As I've cooked more and more the past few years, and I've occasionally been asked for recipes. Unfortunately I'm way too lazy to cook with a recipe. I don't have any measuring spoons, and I hardly visualize the quantity of a cup, a tablespoon, or any legitimate measurement. All I understand is what looks like the "right" amount for the respective amount of meat, vegetables, soup, or whatever it is I'm cooking.

Advantages of cooking this way:

1. I never have to get a measuring spoon
2. I have a deeper understanding of the depth of flavor each ingredient adds
3. It's quicker than measuring

\## Why measurement falls short

Imagine you're following a recipe calls for a tablespoon of fresh cracked black pepper. What brand of black pepper? How coarse the crack size? What if you only have pre-cracked pepper? What if you only have white pepper?

In the end, the recipe does not call for the tablespoon of black pepper, but rather the amount of flavor which a tablespoon of black pepper can provide to the dish. Of course this amount of flavor is dependent on the one who wrote the recipe, or to the one following the recipe's personal tastes, and knowing the ingredient you're using allows you to adjust the dish according to your tastes.
