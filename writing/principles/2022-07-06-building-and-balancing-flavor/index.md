We often hear about 5 main components of flavor: salt, sweet, sour, umami, bitter. This is mostly true, but a little reductive when considering the flavors of meat, peppers, onions, garlic, different spices, etc. The final flavor of any dish is complex and layered, each ingredient contributes to that symphony.

## building flavor

### primary ingredients

Like main characters of a book, too many can be distracting. The reader doesn't know who to focus on, and as a result, the immersion is not as deep. A dish is the same way, just a few stars need to shine, the rest of the ingredients are there to support the main flavors. For example, burgers focus on the beef, the sauce, cheese, bun, pickles are there to support the beef.

When considering primary ingredients, I often think of the core of the dish, whether it's a meat dish, a veggie dish, or some combination. What protein do I want to focus on? What veggie do I want to focus on? What combinations can go together?

### secondary ingredients

This is the supporting cast. It's ok to go a little crazy here, just like how supporting characters bring out different characteristics of the main characters.

Here, I think about the aromatics, the spices, the sauces, that help enhance the flavor of the protein or veggie that I'm cooking. Do I need ginger to suppress the gaminess or fishiness of the protein? What about cooking wine? Does garlic enhance the flavor? (Usually, yes.) Do I want this dish to be spicy, and add chilis, peppercorns, or peppers? Do I want some extra sweetness in this dish? If so, how should that sweetness be incorporated? Does this dish need some extra savoriness? How can I add some ingredients to incorporate that?

## balancing flavor


Is this dish really fatty, and need some acid to help cut the fat and avoid that greasiness?



Figure out which flavors you enjoy, and what works together. Look up common flavor or ingredient combinations.

In the end, how much ingredient should you add so that the flavor adds complexity, but isn't overwhelming? Use your [feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings) or read a real recipe to get some sort of a guesstimate.
