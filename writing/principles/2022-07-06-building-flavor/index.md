We often hear about 5 main components of flavor: salt, sweet, sour, umami, bitter. This is mostly true, but a little reductive when considering the flavors of meat, peppers, onions, garlic, different spices, etc. The final flavor of any dish is complex and layered, each ingredient contributes to that symphony.

## primary ingredients

Like main characters of a book, too many can be distracting. The reader doesn't know who to focus on, and as a result, the immersion is not as deep. A dish is the same way, just a few stars need to shine, the rest of the ingredients are there to support the main flavors. For example, burgers focus on the beef, the sauce, cheese, bun, pickles are there to support the beef.

Figure out which flavors you enjoy, and what works together. Look up common flavor or ingredient combinations.

## secondary ingredients



How much ingredient should you add so that the flavor adds complexity, but isn't overwhelming? Use your [feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings) or read a real recipe to get some sort of a guesstimate.
