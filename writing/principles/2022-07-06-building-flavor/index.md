We often hear about 5 main components of flavor: salt, sweet, sour, umami, bitter. This is mostly true, but a little reductive when considering the flavors of meat, peppers, onions, garlic, different spices, etc. The final flavor of any dish is complex and layered, each ingredient contributes to that symphony.

How much ingredient should you add to get the flavor out? Use your [feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings) or read a real recipe to get some sort of a guesstimate.
