We think of salt as salty. And on it's own, that's true. However, when mixed with other ingredients, like vegetables, meat, spices, it enhances flavor, it brings out the existing flavor in those ingredients so that you can taste it better.

The final dish is only salty if you end up adding too much salt. But a properly salted dish is a fireworks display of balanced flavors, that tells you, this is delicious.

Of course, each person has their own level of appropriate saltiness. This is also dependent on how different flavor components [balance](/principles/balancing-flavor). When cooking for yourself, the appropriate level of saltiness depends on [your feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings).
