If you've had any chance to study graphic design or paintings or art, you've probably come across color theory. The basic premise is that different color schemes bring about different emotions and balance the artwork in different ways. For example, one might use analogous colors like warm reds in a piece of art to evoke feelings of passion and fervor, or complementary colors to create drama and tension, or triadic colors to conjure boldness and confidence.

I find that this is generally applicable to cooking as well. Not in the sense of plating my food to evoke emotions (this is directly applicable to color theory), but in the sense that ingredients often work together because the colors of the ingredients work together (in a color theoretic way). By no means is this scientifically rigorous, and it sounds ridiculous, but this has been a helpful rule of thumb when trying to combine ingredients at home.

Don't take this principle too far, it doesn't work at the extremes. After all, very few ingredients have cool hues like blue or purple. But, I'll try to illustrate two main principles:
1. Cook with analogous colors
1. Cook with contrasting colors

I've also listed a smattering of ingredients and their associated colors at the bottom for you to get a better sense of how to associate ingredients and their colors.

## Cook with analogous colors

### Hong shao rou (红烧肉)

It's already in the name (red-braised pork), but clearly 

### Most veggie stir frys

Since veggies are green, a lot of veggie stir frys focus on presenting that bright green color. Of course you can deviate by adding soy sauce or oyster sauce, 

### Mango habanero

Mangos and habaneros both give warm orange tones, and now it's one of the most popular hot sauce combinations.

## Cook with contrasting colors

### Steamed fish

### Hui guo rou (回锅肉)

## Colors of ingredients

Here's a variety of foods and their colors that I listed off the top of my head. It's not exhaustive at all, but there's generally a bias towards the warmer side of the color spectrum.
