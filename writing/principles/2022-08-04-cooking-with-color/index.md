If you've had any chance to study graphic design or paintings or art, you've probably come across color theory. The basic premise is that different color schemes bring about different emotions and balance the artwork in different ways.

I find that this is generally applicable to cooking as well. Not in the sense of plating my food to be appealing to the eye, because that's directly applicable to color theory, but in the sense that ingredients and flavor profiles work together because the colors of the ingredients and feelings of each flavor work together (in a color theoretic way). By no means is this scientifically rigorous, and it sounds ridiculous, but this has been a helpful rule of thumb when trying to combine ingredients at home.
