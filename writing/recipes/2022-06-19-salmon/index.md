This was one of the things I made in college when I needed some protein and wasn't able to get into a dining hall.

## Stuff you'll need

1. Some salmon
1. Some onion
1. Some acid (lemon juice works well, apple cider vinegar isn't bad either. I wouldn't go with fermented or aged vinegars like balsamic though.)
1. (Optionally) some cooking wine
