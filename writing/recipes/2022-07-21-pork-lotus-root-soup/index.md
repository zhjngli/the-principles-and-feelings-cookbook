A simple, savory, nutritious soup that is comforting and warms your soul.

## Stuff you'll need

- Pork ribs (spare ribs or baby back ribs are both fine)
    - Or, any kind of pork bones with some meat on it. The bones impart a lot of flavor, and the meat is for eating. If you just want the flavor, you could go for mostly bones without a lot of meat. I find that ribs have a good combination of both.
- Lotus root
- Salt
- MSG
- White pepper (black pepper is fine too)
- Ginger
- Cooking wine

## Preparation

Chop the pork ribs or pork bones into manageable chunks. Manageable as in: can it fit in your mouth, or can you suck on it to get the meat off the bone?

Let the pork soak in some water for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This draws out some of the blood in the bones and meat so that the resulting soup doesn't have as much of the resulting scum. To avoid even more scum, you can parboil the pork to draw it out, and rinse it all off. I avoid parboiling because it's an extra step and I'm lazy.
