"Stir-fry" is used loosely here, as I cook at home, without insanely hot burners that can singe the oil in the wok and create little smoky charred bits of food. Honestly it's probably closer to a steam/boiled veggie, but still tasty. If you do have a legit burner and a serious wok, you'll have to look up some real wok technique. Can't help you there. But I think the overall preparation and flavoring are generally applicable.

This is one of those things that have so many possible combinations and preparations. I'll try to give examples of what's possible, and general guidelines, but it's definitely encouraged to experiment outside of what's listed here.

## Components

1. A veggie (I'll list common veggies that I use in a table below)
1. A base ingredient (Garlic is almost always used. Other times I'll use other ingredients to add extra complexity or an umami boost.)
1. Simple seasonings (salt, pepper, MSG, sugar)
1. A sauce (soy sauce, oyster sauce, or some mixture)

## Preparation

Since I'm using weaker burners, sometimes it's helpful to parboil the veggie beforehand. This only applies to chunkier veggies that take a longer time to cook sufficiently, like broccoli, bok choy, or string beans. For leafier greens that cook quickly I usually skip this step. Simply parboil the veggies until they are cooked most of the way through and are ready for the stir-fry. Drain the veggies so they don't have much surface moisture. This will help them fry up better.

In a wok, heat up oil and add the base ingredients to draw out the flavor. Make sure the oil isn't too hot so that it burns these ingredients, but not cold enough so that the ingredients just soak up the oil. Since these ingredients provide the base flavoring for the rest of the dish, it's important to extract as much flavor as possible.

Add in your veggies and stir-fry. The veggies will likely start to sweat some moisture if you're on a weak stove. This is a major transgression for true wok technique, the goal of a stir-fry is to slightly char the outside of the food for flavor, and lock in the moisture. But if you care that much go get a portable burner or something.

When the veggies are mostly done, add in your seasonings or your sauce. My mom says adding the salt late in the stir-fry preserves the bright green of the veggie. I've never tested this, but who am I to distrust the woman who fed me for most of my life? When adding the sauce, make sure to coat the veggies, and let the heat of the wok cook it a little so there's more complex roasted flavors, and less moisture.

## Base ingredients

Just some samples of base ingredients that I use. Get a feeling for what I use and why I use it, and experiment with the spices or ingredients that you like.

### Garlic

Garlic tastes great, when would you not use it? Never. Except when cooking something like garlic chives, which already has a garlicky flavor. So the answer is still never. If you disagree, stop reading and go home.

### Ginger

I almost never do this because I'm lazy, and I like to use ginger for meat applications more than veggie applications. But it's totally reasonable to add a light refreshing difference to the stir-fry.

### Spices

Most often I'll only use some chili flakes for heat, or some crushed sichuan peppercorns for a floral, citrus note, but not enough to make the resulting dish numbing. Other spices are totally viable too, experiment with it!

### Dried shrimp

This has a ton of umami, it's fantastic. I use it for veggies that don't have a lot of flavor on their own and need an extra boost. Or just to add extra complexity.

### Fermented black beans

This has a funkiness, and complements umami ingredients very well. I'll often use it with the dried shrimp. It can be a little salty, so probably use less salt later.

### zha cai (榨菜)

This is a pickled mustard green. It adds some funkiness and umami to the dish. It's almost like a cheat code because it already tastes pretty good on its own, and adds that special something to the veggie.

### Sauces

Don't you already have another section for sauces? Yea, but these sauces are a little different. I often get things like some sort of chili crisp, chili paste, broad bean paste, or other similar Chinese flavorings. It helps to add these kinds of sauces as a base ingredient to help bring out the flavors. If zha cai was a cheat code, this is like exodia, since it'll do all the heavy lifting in the stir-fry.

## Sauces

### Soy sauce

A funky fermented sauce that adds saltiness and umami to the veggie. Helpful especially when adding other ingredients with more "complex" flavor, like a chili crisp, or fermented black beans, etc.

### Oyster sauce

I don't know a lot about this sauce honestly, but it works well in adding umami, in a different way than soy sauce does. Also works well with marinating beef.

### Cooking wine

I've seen this used sparingly just to add a slightly more complex flavor. Too much can be overwhelming, but mostly it's for saltiness, and to round out the bite of certain veggies.

### Some mix

Of course it's helpful to mix some sauces too. A simple one would be some soy sauce, cooking wine, and water. Or oyster sauce, cooking wine, and water. Or all of the above. It's about experimenting to find what you like.
