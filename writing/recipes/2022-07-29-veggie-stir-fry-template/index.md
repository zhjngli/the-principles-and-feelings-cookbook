"Stir-fry" is used loosely here, as I cook at home, without insanely hot burners that can singe the oil in the wok and create little smoky charred bits of food. Honestly it's probably closer to a steam/boiled veggie, but still tastier. If you do have a legit burner and a serious wok, you'll have to look up some real wok technique. Can't help you there. But I think the overall preparation and flavoring are generally applicable.

This is one of those things that have so many possible combinations and preparations. I'll try to give examples of what's possible, and general guidelines, but it's definitely encouraged to experiment outside of what's listed here.

## Components

1. A veggie (I'll list common veggies that I use in a table below)
1. A base flavor (Garlic is almost always used. Other times I'll use other ingredients to add extra complexity or an umami boost.)
1. Simple seasonings (salt, pepper, MSG, sugar), or a sauce (soy sauce, oyster sauce, or some mixture)
