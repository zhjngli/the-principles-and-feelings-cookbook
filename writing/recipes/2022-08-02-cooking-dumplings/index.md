I've written about [dumpling skins](/recipes/homemade-dumpling-skins) and [dumpling filling](/recipes/dumpling-filling) already. But how do you cook them? The great thing about this is, you don't have to make your own dumplings to cook them, you can buy them from the frozen section of your grocery store too.

## Boil it

Boil some water. Put the dumplings in. Stir the dumplings so they don't stick to the bottom of the pot. Once the dumplings float, cook it a few more minutes depending on the size of the dumplings. Or, add some water, and wait for the pot to boil again, and do that repeatedly until your [feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings) tell you the dumplings are cooked.

## Pan fry it

This doesn't work well for frozen dumplings since pan frying frozen things is usually kind of a pain. It takes longer, releases more moisture, doesn't fry super well, etc.

Add some oil to a pan. Heat it up, and add in the dumplings. Use a medium to medium-high heat so that the dumplings don't burn. Once the skin is a nice golden brown, you can either turn the dumplings to pan fry a different side, or add some water, and cover the pan, to let the dumplings steam the rest of the way.
