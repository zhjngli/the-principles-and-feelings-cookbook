It doesn't make sense to make [dumpling skins](/recipes/homemade-dumpling-skins) without some filling.

## Stuff you'll need

* For the filling:
  * ground pork or beef or lamb
  * Chinese chives or cabbage
  * (optional) shrimp
  * (optional) mushroom
  * (optional) carrot
* For the seasoning:
  * cooking wine
  * oil
  * soy sauce
  * salt
  * white pepper
  * (optional) other spices that go well with the meat of choice
* For folding dumplings:
  * friends

## Preparation

I don't know what other people say about dumpling filling, but the most important thing in my opinion is the emulsification of the meat. Ground meat is necessarily grainy, because it's meat that's pushed through small holes. But the ideal texture of the meat in a dumpling filling is creamy, rather than grainy or sandy.

So, get all your ground meat, and stir it in one direction for a while using chopsticks. Once you see that the lean meat and fat are emulsified together, where there are almost thin strands of meat left behind by the chopstick trail, you can be somewhat confident that the meat is emulsified. Stir it some more in the same direction to be sure.
