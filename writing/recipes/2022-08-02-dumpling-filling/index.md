It doesn't make sense to make [dumpling skins](/recipes/homemade-dumpling-skins) without some filling.

## Stuff you'll need

* For the filling:
  * ground pork or beef or lamb
  * Chinese chives or cabbage
  * (optional) shrimp
  * (optional) mushroom
  * (optional) carrot
  * (optional) other stuff that might taste good
* For the seasoning:
  * cooking wine
  * oil
  * soy sauce
  * salt
  * MSG
  * white pepper
  * (optional) other spices that go well with the meat
* For folding dumplings:
  * friends

## Preparation

### Seasoning the meat

Add all the seasonings to your ground meat. Since I'm Chinese, I usually use the classics: soy sauce, cooking wine, salt, MSG, white pepper. And I usually just use ground pork.

I also like to add some oil to help the resulting texture be a little more creamy. A neutral oil is fine, but something like scallion or sesame oil can also be used, to impart an extra aroma and lift to the final filling.

### Emulsifying the meat

I don't know what other people say about dumpling filling, but the most important thing in my opinion is the emulsification of the meat. Ground meat is necessarily grainy, because it's meat that's pushed through small holes. But the ideal texture of the meat in a dumpling filling is creamy, rather than grainy or sandy.

So, get all your ground meat, and stir it in one direction for a while using chopsticks. Once you see that the lean meat and fat are emulsified together, where there are almost thin strands of meat left behind by the chopstick trail, you can be somewhat confident that the meat is emulsified. Stir it some more in the same direction to be sure.

### Adding the other stuff

For the most part, you just need to chop up whatever ingredients you want to add really really finely, and fold it into the emulsified meat mixture. However, a few things to keep in mind:
- Don't add too many ingredients. 3 ingredients including the meat is a good amount.
- Think about flavor profiles when combining these ingredients.
- For ingredients that have a lot of water, you'll need to get that moisture out first, so that the resulting filling doesn't becoming a watery mess.



## Final thoughts

You could totally make beef or lamb dumplings too. They're not unknown in the realm of Chinese dumplings, but I usually just make dumplings with ground pork. Of course, with different meats, different spices would complement the flavor profile of the meat. Use your [feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings) or understanding of different flavor profiles to come up with unique takes on dumplings! If you want to try Italian seasonings, since they've got some pretty good sausages over there, why not? I don't think dumplings are local to Chinese cuisine; there's some form of meat filling wrapped in a dough ball in every cuisine.
