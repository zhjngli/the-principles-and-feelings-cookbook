Admittedly, this is a lot of work for noodles. But the bite, chew, and texture you get from homemade, hand-pulled noodles is vastly different from the dried stuff in grocery stores.

## Stuff you'll need

- flour (probably all-purpose)
- water
- salt

## Preparation

Mix the flour, water, and salt together, and knead. I usually do this on a large cutting board. By the end of kneading, 3 things should be clean and glossy: the surface of the dough, the cutting board, and your hands. No more flour, or clammy, sticky dough should be left on any of those surfaces.

Lightly oil the dough on the surface, cover it, and let it rest for up to 5 hours. This allows the gluten network to form and get stronger in the dough, so that the dough won't break when you start pulling it. At least, I think that's how the science works, don't trust me. 

Now, depending how talented you are, the next steps will be either annoying or really fast.

### Pull one bowl of noodles at a time

Honestly if you can do this, why are you even here? Split the dough into balls corresponding to each serving. Pull the dough, fold it, pull again, and repeat until the resulting noodles are the desired thickness. Then boil it.

I can't do this, I've just seen people in restaurants do it. It's pretty amazing, and super efficient.

### Pull individual noodles separately

Roll out the dough to rectangular-ish shape, with a thickness slightly thicker than the desired end result.
