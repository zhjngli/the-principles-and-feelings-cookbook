Admittedly, this is a lot of work for noodles. But the bite, chew, and texture you get from homemade, hand-pulled noodles is vastly different from the dried stuff in grocery stores.

## Stuff you'll need

- flour (probably all-purpose)
- water
- salt

## Preparation

Mix the flour, water, and salt together, and knead. I usually do this on a large cutting board. By the end of kneading, 3 things should be clean and glossy: the surface of the dough, the cutting board, and your hands. No more flour, or clammy, sticky dough should be left on any of those surfaces. Make sure the dough is the right texture, it should have a little give, but bounce back eventually. If it's too hard or too soft, you'll need to work in more water or flour. This is even more based on [feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings) than my other recipes because 

Lightly oil the dough on the surface and cover it, to prevent the dough from drying. Let it rest for up to 5 hours. Resting allows the gluten network to form and get stronger in the dough, so that the dough won't break when you start pulling it. At least, I think that's how the science works, don't trust me. 

Now, depending how talented you are, the next steps will be either annoying or really fast.

### Pull one bowl of noodles at a time

Honestly if you can do this, why are you even here? Split the dough into balls corresponding to each serving. Pull the dough, fold it, pull again, and repeat until the resulting noodles are the desired thickness. Then boil it.

I can't do this, I've just seen people in restaurants do it. It's pretty amazing, and super efficient.

### Pull individual noodles separately

Roll out the dough to rectangular-ish shape, with a thickness slightly thicker than the desired end result. Cut the dough into logs of even thickness, and pull it to about 2 or 3 times the original length. Continue with the rest of the dough. Make sure each individual log doesn't dry out by keeping it covered, or by working with only parts of the dough at a time.

Finally, pull each individual log until it reaches the desired thickness, or before it snaps. Boil all these noodles!

## Notes

- It's important to keep the dough from drying out throughout the process. Dry dough becomes more brittle and easier to snap when pulling.
