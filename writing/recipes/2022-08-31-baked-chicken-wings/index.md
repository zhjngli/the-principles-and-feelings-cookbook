## Stuff you'll need

1. chicken wings
1. salt
1. (optionally) MSG
1. (optionally) cooking wine
1. (optionally) white pepper

## Preparation

Pat the chicken wings as dry as possible. Dry [brine](/techniques/brining) the wings with all the other ingredients. [Bake](/techniques/baking) the chicken with the skin side facing up. Use some oil or cooking spray on the baking tray so that the chicken doesn't stick. Broil the chicken at the very end to crisp up the skin. The chicken is good enough to eat, but to add extra flavor, toss the chicken in some [garlic chili sauce](/recipes/garlic-chili-sauce).

## Notes

There will probably also be a lot of oil and juice drippings from the chicken left in the baking tray. Save that to use for a chicken noodle soup in a later meal!
