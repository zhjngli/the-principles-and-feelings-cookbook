This might be the easiest recipe ever. And it's pretty high yield in terms of taste too.

## Stuff you'll need

1. Lobster
1. Water I guess

## Preparation

Steam the lobster.

Dip it in some [garlic chili sauce](/recipes/garlic-chili-sauce) or some other sauce of your liking.

## Notes

I don't know, what else can I say. Lobster is naturally sweet and briny so not much seasoning is needed. If you want to do more you could clean the lobster by removing the poop track. Actually you should probably do this, poop tracks are gross.
