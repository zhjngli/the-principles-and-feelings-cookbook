Brining meat helps soak flavor into the meat, and it prevents the muscle proteins from tightening too much when cooking, which would draw out extra moisture. The result is a juicier piece of cooked meat. This particularly helps with dryer pieces of meat like chicken breast.

To do this, cover the meat in water, and add some salt too. Let the salt dissolve, and let it brine in the fridge for some time. Use your [feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings) to figure out how long. 1 minute is probably too short, 1 year and the meat might rot. The salt solution will denature the meat proteins or something like that, so when cooking, the proteins don't tighten as much, leaving behind more tender and juicy meat.

You could also dry brine, by covering the meat sufficiently in salt. The salt will draw out moisture, and then penetrate into the meat to denature the proteins.

Sometimes I add MSG too. I don't know if it does anything, but I pretend like it does and the placebo is real. I've also tried adding spices, and as much as I'd like to pretend that this does something, I don't think spices release that much flavor in water, and spices tend to be more expensive, so I stopped doing this.
