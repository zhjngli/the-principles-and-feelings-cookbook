I think of cooking wine as shaoxing wine, a quintessential cooking wine in Chinese cooking. Honestly, the only two things I know about it are:

1. A little goes a long way. Don't use too much.
1. It's mostly used to suppress some gamey flavors in meat. Whether it's used in marinades, soups, or stir fries, it's pretty effective.
