I think of cooking wine as shaoxing wine, a quintessential cooking wine in Chinese cooking. Honestly, the only two things I know about it are:

1. It's mostly used to suppress some gamey flavors in meat. Whether it's used in marinades, soups, or stir fries, it's pretty effective.
1. A little goes a long way. Don't use too much. It's pretty salty too, so you can use a little less salt when using this ingredient.

Are there replacements? Probably. Do I know what's a good replacement? Nope, go find out yourself by experimenting and using your [feelings](/principles/cooking-with-feelings).
