Just some samples of base ingredients that I use. Get a feeling for what I use and why I use it, and experiment with the spices or ingredients that you like.

### Garlic

Garlic tastes great, when would you not use it? Never. Except when cooking something like garlic chives, which already has a garlicky flavor. So the answer is still never. If you disagree, stop reading and go home.

### Ginger

I almost never do this because I'm lazy, and I like to use ginger for meat applications more than veggie applications. But it's totally reasonable to add a light refreshing difference to the stir-fry.

### Spices

Most often I'll only use some chili flakes for heat, or some crushed sichuan peppercorns for a floral, citrus note, but not enough to make the resulting dish numbing. Other spices are totally viable too, experiment with it!

### Dried shrimp

This has a ton of umami, it's fantastic. I use it for veggies that don't have a lot of flavor on their own and need an extra boost. Or just to add extra complexity.

### Fermented black beans

This has a funkiness, and complements umami ingredients very well. I'll often use it with the dried shrimp. It can be a little salty, so probably use less salt later.

### zha cai (榨菜)

This is a pickled mustard green. It adds some funkiness and umami to the dish. It's almost like a cheat code because it already tastes pretty good on its own, and adds that special something to the veggie.
