Some common sauces I use when I [stir-fry veggies](/recipes/veggie-stir-fry-template). Often used with other [base flavorings](/techniques/base-flavorings) to boost the existing flavor or draw out more flavor. Too much sauce isn't always a good thing, so be picky and experiment with what works.

## Soy sauce

A funky fermented sauce that adds saltiness and umami to the veggie. Helpful especially when adding other ingredients with more "complex" flavor, like a chili crisp, or fermented black beans, etc.

## Oyster sauce

I don't know a lot about this sauce honestly, but it works well in adding umami, in a different way than soy sauce does. Also works well with marinating beef.

## Cooking wine

I've seen this used sparingly just to add a slightly more complex flavor. Too much can be overwhelming, but mostly it's for saltiness, and to round out the bite of certain veggies.

## Some mix

Of course it's helpful to mix some sauces too. A simple one would be some soy sauce, cooking wine, and water. Or oyster sauce, cooking wine, and water. Or all of the above. It's about experimenting to find what you like.
